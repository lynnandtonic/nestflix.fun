  "description": "Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came. And that’s when things got knocked into 12th gear. A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from tomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business.",
